A collection of non-medical item animations, models and textures. As many items as possible were converted to fancier gunslinger animations. Some items had their use sounds replaced/enhanced. Items that lacked animations now have them. Originally made/adapted for ‚Å†BHS realistic overhaul by me, but separated out into a separate mod. Fully DLTX.

Goes hand in hand with BHS Realistic Overhaul. This mod was originally a part of it.

- vodka(s) - Gunslinger animation with a different model and textures for both
- Gerkules(drug_booster) - Gunslinger anim + model.
- Anabiotic - Gunslinger anim + model.
- Nuts,raisins - FDDA can model but with nuts and raisins respectively.
- Salmon - FDDA fish can anim, unchanged.
- Energy drink - Gunslinger anim with a different texture(Non stop)
- Water drink(can) - Energy drink but with a water can texture(edited).
- Mineral water - Vanilla water bottle adapted to gunslinger drinking animation (took some Blender lessons)
- Quality vodka,metal flask - Flask reanimation with a texture and a customised sound(a bigger sip)
- Water Flask - Gunslinger water flask, unchanged.
- Beard's tea - Mineral water but retextured for tea.
- Tobacco,joint,marijuana,cigar - retextured FDDA smoking.
- Mints - very appropriately, a pills animation with a retexture for mints. Works very well
